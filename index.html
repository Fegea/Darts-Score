  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the Darts Score application, created and operated
    by Florian EGEA. Its purpose is to inform users about the collection, use,
    and disclosure of information when using the application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
    This includes, but is not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Postal address</li>
    <li>Precise geographic location</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The application does not require you to create an account and does not store
    personal profiles of any kind.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Automatically Collected Data</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not directly collect or store user data. However, certain third-party
    services integrated into the app (such as advertising providers) may collect
    anonymous device data for their own purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following Android permissions:</p>

  <p>
    <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code><br>
    Used to access the internet for displaying advertisements and improving the user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code><br>
    Required to access the advertising ID used by Google Play Services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    The application uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve advertisements.
    AdMob may collect anonymous data to personalize and improve ad relevance.
  </p>

  <p>AdMob may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (resettable by the user)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, etc.)</li>
    <li>App interaction information (e.g., views of non-personalized ads)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AdMob does <strong>not</strong> collect information that personally identifies you.
  </p>

  <p>
    To learn more about how Google uses data and your options to control ad
    personalization, please review Google's Privacy Policy:<br>

    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    The app itself does not process or store personal information. Anonymous
    device data collected by third-party services is used for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying ads</li>
    <li>Improving service stability and performance</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention and analytics (performed by third parties)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Although we do not store personal information, we take reasonable measures
    to ensure the app communicates securely with third-party services.
    However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we
    cannot guarantee absolute protection.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not target children under 13. No personal information is collected
    from any user, regardless of age.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses third-party services that may collect anonymous, non-personal data.
    These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these services.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements or regulatory
    requirements. You are advised to review this page periodically for changes.
