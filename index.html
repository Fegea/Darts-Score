  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Darts Score</strong> mobile application
    created and operated by <strong>Florian EGEA</strong>. It explains what information
    (if any) the app collects, how that information is used, and your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary (short version)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
    <li>All game data (scores, match history) is stored locally on your device only.</li>
    <li>The app displays ads served by Google AdMob; AdMob may collect anonymous device data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Darts Score does not collect your name, email address, phone number, or precise
    geographic location. You do not need to create an account to use the app.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Local Data (on-device database)</h2>
  <p>
    The app stores match and score history in a local database on your device (for example,
    to let you review past games or resume matches). This data remains on your device and
    is <strong>not</strong> automatically uploaded to any server or shared with third parties
    by the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you enable any backup or export feature (none enabled by default), that action will
    be explicitly requested by the app and described to you before any data leaves the device.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>The app declares the following permissions in its Android manifest:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> — required to load and display advertisements and for any optional online features.</li>
    <li><code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code> — declared to use the Advertising ID required by Google Play Services for AdMob.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No location, contacts, or storage permissions are requested by default. If you see additional permission requests, the app will request them at runtime and explain why.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    Ads in this app are served by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect anonymous device information to deliver and personalize ads, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a resettable advertising identifier (Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>approximate location information inferred from IP (not precise GPS)</li>
    <li>device and app information (model, OS version, app interactions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is collected by AdMob (a third party) and not by the Darts Score app itself.
    Ad personalization settings and opt-out options are provided by Google. For details, see Google’s privacy resources:
    <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you prefer non-personalized ads (NPA), configure the ad personalization settings on your device or follow Google’s instructions to control ad personalization.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    The app itself does not transmit or process personal information. Any anonymous
    device data collected by third-party ad providers is used for ad serving, analytics
    and improving ad relevance. The local match history is used only to display your
    previous games within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Local game data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it (for example,
    via a built-in delete or clear history action) or you uninstall the app. Third-party
    advertisers retain the anonymous data they collect according to their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Reasonable technical measures are used to protect local data on the device. However,
    no method of storage or transmission is completely secure — the app cannot guarantee
    absolute security of data on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information,
    please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses third-party services (Google AdMob) that have their own privacy policies.
    We encourage you to review those policies to understand how they use data.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because the app does not collect personal information, there is little personal data
    for us to modify or delete. If you have concerns about local game data, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>delete match history from within the app (if the app exposes such a function),</li>
    <li>uninstall the app to remove app data stored in the app's private storage on the device,</li>
    <li>contact us at the address below for any specific requests or clarifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This policy may be updated from time to time (for example, to reflect changes in
    third-party services or legal requirements). The "Last updated" line below will
    show the month and year of the latest update.
  </p>
